# U2U-AE
USB to UART Based on CH340G for Arduino and ESP
<br> Description will be added soon...

<b>
What is U2U-AE?
</b><br>
Well U2U-AE is a simple USB to UART converter that allow you to program AVR and ESP MCUs really easily, for AVR you just need GND, RX and TX lines... sometimes DTR too (for auto reset). For ESP8266 you also need nRST and GPIO0 to put ESP8266 into the correct mood at the right time.(google esp8266 bare minimum for more info about the simplest way you can run ESP8266)

	What is diffrent about U2U-AE?
</b><br>
	Actually nothing is special about this board, with a little patience you can use any USB to UART board for serial cominucation but there are some advanges when you gather every feature on one single board...
<br>
	-Uses cheap and readily avaible parts you can find in any country
<br>
	-Small PCB with maximum uses of space (as much as possible)
<br>
	-Fully documented and public knowlegde
<br>
	-Compeletly free of charge for any type of use
<br>
	-Fully compatible with most AVR and ESP MCUs and many more devices probably
<br>
	-Work with both 3.3V and 5V MCUs
<br>
	-Power can be provided via a sepereate micro usb port to avoid damages to your PC
<br>
	-Fused power line for more protection
<br>
	-Seperate LEDs for RX TX DTR and Power indication
<br>
	-Can be easily adapted to USB-C connector or any other changes

	In a nutshell:
</b><br>
	Is it perfect? Probably not. Does it do flipovers? Of cource not. Is it the best possible design? Far from it. But will it solve every need for a USB to UART? Most certainly will do!
